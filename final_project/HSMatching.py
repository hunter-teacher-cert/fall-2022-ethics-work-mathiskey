# Final Project: High School Matching Algorithm - Code Portion
# by Shana Elizabeth Henry and Katherine (Kate) Maschmeyer
# 
# Demonstrates the algorithm & set up displayed in videos from https://medium.com/algorithms-in-the-wild/decoding-the-nyc-school-admission-lottery-numbers-bae7148e337d
# Students are set up for processing in random order (not alphabetical), but results are the same
