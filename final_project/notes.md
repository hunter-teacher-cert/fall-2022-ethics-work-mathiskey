HS Matching Notes

Each student has:
- Name
- Generate random lottery number (using UUID)
- import uuid
- for i in range(1,10): print(uuid.uuid4())

Ranking of schools
- Whether student is zoned (& for which school)
- Whether student is in set-aside category
- Current top preferred school

Each school has:
- Name
- Zoned or not
- List of student spots (initially empty, hard limit on number of spots)
- % of seats that are set-aside (might store as number of seats that are set-aside)

There are many more HS than students. For our simulation, we'll simulate what happened in video (equal number of students and schools)
Algorithm works to maximize overall student satisfaction
stable matching at end of algorithm: no student & school match that would rather be matched with each other than the pair they are match with
students propose matches, not schools

Take into account: lottery number, priority, zoning
Assuming for sake of ease that priority and zoning are mutually exclusive in our algorithm
Data structures
Student object:

Name (string)
Random lottery number (for now: int)
Ranking of schools (array of strings?)
Zoned for school (name: boolean)
Priority (boolean)
Current match (school object)
School object:

Name (string)
Zoned (boolean)
Number of available seats (int)
% of priority seats (float?)
Seats (array of students)
Algorithm
Set up students, schools

Create mutable list of unmatched students (alphabetical order?)

Functions: student.match(school) - set matches in each student & school object, student.lookForMatch() school.hasPrioritySeating() school.lowestLotteryNumber() school.getMatchesWithZone() school.gebtMatchesWithPriority()

while unmatchedStudents.len > 0:
  currStudent = unmatchedStudents[0]

  currSchool = currStudent's current top school
  
  if currSchool has a spot:
    currStudent.match(currSchool)
    unmatchedStudents.remove(currentStudent) 
  else:  // no spots free
      if currSchool.isZoned():
        if currStudent is zoned for currSchool:
            if unzoned students already matched with school:
              remove unzoned student with lowest lottery number
              currStudent.match(currSchool)
              continue with removed student
            else: // all spots have zoned students
              find which student has lowest lottery number
              if currStudent has lowest:
                set currStudent's top school to next on list, try to match
              else:  // student has higher
                remove lowest lottery student
                currStudent.match(currSchool)
                continue with removed student  
              
        else: // student not zoned for school (but school is)
        
           
      else: // school not zoned
        if currSchool has priority spots:
            if currStudent has priority:
              if priority spots filled with priority students:
                check lottery number ...
              else:
                check students without priority - which has lowest lottery number... 
            else: // student does not have priority
            find which student has lowest lottery number
              if currStudent has lowest:
                set currStudent's top school to next on list, try to match
              else: 
                remove lowest lottery student
                currStudent.match(currSchool)
                continue with removed student

        else:  // school not zoned, no priority
          check for lowest lottery number ...
